# NeroTech

> Part of the [Neroland](../neroland-mc-ecosystem) sci-fi Minecraft mod ecosystem, built on **Neroland Core**.

**Status:** in development — version `0.0.1-alpha.2`. All 9 Phase-3 machines are implemented (generators incl. Nero Generator, Solar Array, and a single-block Fusion Reactor; processors; automation machines), plus heat management, regional pollution with opt-in per-player attribution, and Core progression-gate integration (`INDUSTRIAL_POWER`, `REACHED_ORBIT`). Models, textures, blockstates, recipes, and lang files are complete; advancements and datapack-overridable ore recipes are still outstanding.

## Build targets

- **Minecraft:** 26.1.2 and 26.2
- **Loaders:** NeoForge, MinecraftForge/Forge, Fabric (the "6 cells")
- **Java:** 25
- Mod id: `nerotech` · package `za.co.neroland.nerotech`

## Layout

The build is the repo root, with a flattened cross-loader structure driven by Stonecutter:

- `common/` — shared, loader-agnostic source spliced into every loader node
- `fabric/` — Fabric Loom
- `forge/` — ForgeGradle
- `neoforge/` — ModDevGradle
- `stonecutter.gradle` — the real root build script; `build.gradle` is intentionally inert

## Building

```sh
./gradlew :fabric:26.2:build          # one cell
./gradlew :neoforge:26.1.2:build :neoforge:26.2:build \
          :forge:26.1.2:build :forge:26.2:build \
          :fabric:26.1.2:build :fabric:26.2:build   # all six
```
